# First Aid Specialist Agent - CSC 581

## Introduction

This agent is built to assist search and rescue personnel in a rescue or first aid situation. It contains a RAG database with expert first aid documents that it will pull from to generate recommendations. It also has the ability to locate the current weather and the nearest hospital to SAR personnel. It can be used to inform decisions in the field on what first aid best practices are.
